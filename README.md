Theme: BusinessGeneral 

Idea: Application created in Android Studio by Miranda, Mitchell, LaKorte, & Rob.

Targeted currently towards construction work, the application would deliver 3-fold: tracks & incentivizes employee
clock-in/out & break-in/outs tracked and verified by GPS location in relation to employer-posted jobsite coordinates;
compiles this data for employers to utilize; and provides a platform with which to document and publicize/advertise
jobsite progress & interaction/impediment to the community via social media integration & GPS pinning.

App begins with a login screen. Users may log in using email and a password, or log in using Facebook or Google
credentials.Upon logging in, the interface displays a timer with a button underneath allowing manual clocking in/out.

There are buttons to access a page that describes hours worked this week and estimated pay rates, another to access
accumulated incentive rewards, a button to access settings foralarms and reminders, and a button each for Facebook,
Google Maps, and Waze with which to share photos and location data with the community – i.e. progression photos of
the jobsite and for pinning areas where the jobsite may interfere with traffic/daily commutes.GPS 

Functionality: Upon arriving at the jobsite pinned by a supervisor, app would prompt the user to clock in. Tapping 
“clock in” startsthe timer within the app and begins logging time worked. If the user does not manually clock out
when they leave the jobsite, the app will prompt them to clock out.If a user is the first or last to leave the 
jobsite, app will prompt them to snap a photo of the jobsite and share it to social media to document and showcase
progress.If a user has clocked in & out on time, taken timely breaks, and participates in photo sharing/location
pinning, those actions create incentive points within the app, that they will be able to redeem for rewards deemed
appropriate by the company (gift cards/free lunches/etc.) 

The alarms and reminders can be customized by both the employee & owner/supervisor. You may set alarms to wake up,
 reminders for shifts/breaks, reminders to relocate to other jobsites or to pick up materials. These reminders can
 also be tied to GPS proximity – for instance you have broke out for lunch and have an hour lunch – you can set a
 reminder based upon your GPS location telling you when you should head back to make it on time. 

Owners/Supervisors will be able to log into the app with Supervisor accounts and view concise, sortable
tables of data collected about their employees. Who is showing up on time, who is late, who is early, who is or isn’t
taking appropriate breaks, who is trying to clock in/out when not physically near jobsites, and who is interacting
with the community the most/least with photos and GPS pinning, and of course keep track of hours worked.
